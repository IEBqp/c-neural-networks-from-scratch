## Why?
I want to familiarize myself with the C language, its syntax, and manual memory management. Since I am also studying Neural Networks, I decided to "kill two birds with one stone" by implementing AI concepts in a low-level language. This approach removes the "magic" of high-level libraries and forces a deep understanding of the underlying math and architecture.

## Resources
The primary resource for this project is **"Neural Networks and Deep Learning"** by Michael Nielsen. 

> **Note:** While I may eventually move to Python for more complex deep learning projects, this repository serves as  a way for me to practice C and get into neural networks and deep learning. I am making this public so people I know who are also interested in this may follow along.

## Running Examples
To build an example located in `examples/example_name.c`:

1. **Compile:** `make bin/example_name`
2. **Run:** `./bin/example_name`
3. **Clean build files:** `make clean`

Executables are stored in the `bin/` directory (which will be automatically created for the first execution).

## Commit History & Curriculum
The commit history is a chronological record of my learning path:
* **Feature Synchronization:** I only implement concepts (like the training algorithm) once I have reached that specific chapter in my studies.
* **Documentation:** Commit descriptions often contain technical details about the neural structures implemented in that push.
